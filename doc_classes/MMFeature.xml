	<description>
		[MMFeature] is a base class for features used in motion matching. A feature describes a specific aspect of animations, that can be used to match against at runtime. When baking animation libraries, [MMFeature]s are used to generate motion data.
		[MMFeature]s can be normalized in different ways, such as raw, standard, or min-max normalization. The normalization ensures that different features are on the same scale, and therefore have (by default) an equal impact on the matching result.

	<methods>
		<method name="get_dimension_count" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the number of dimensions of the feature. This is the number of values that the feature will output per animation frame.

	<members>
		<member name="maxes" type="PackedFloat32Array" setter="set_maxes" getter="get_maxes" default="PackedFloat32Array()">
			Maximum values for each dimension of the feature. This is used for normalization, is generated by the Motion Matching editor tool and should not be modified.
		</member>
		<member name="means" type="PackedFloat32Array" setter="set_means" getter="get_means" default="PackedFloat32Array()">
			Mean values for each dimension of the feature. This is used for normalization, is generated by the Motion Matching editor tool and should not be modified.
		</member>
		<member name="mins" type="PackedFloat32Array" setter="set_mins" getter="get_mins" default="PackedFloat32Array()">
			Minimum values for each dimension of the feature. This is used for normalization, is generated by the Motion Matching editor tool and should not be modified.
		</member>
		<member name="normalization_mode" type="int" setter="set_normalization_mode" getter="get_normalization_mode" enum="MMFeature.NormalizationMode" default="1">
			The normalization mode used for the feature. Can be one of [constant Raw], [constant Standard], or [constant MinMax].
		</member>
		<member name="std_devs" type="PackedFloat32Array" setter="set_std_devs" getter="get_std_devs" default="PackedFloat32Array()">
			Standard deviation values for each dimension of the feature. This is used for normalization, is generated by the Motion Matching editor tool and should not be modified.
		</member>
		<member name="weight" type="float" setter="set_weight" getter="get_weight" default="1.0">
			The weight of the feature. This is used to scale the feature's output, and therefore its impact on the matching result. Higher values will make the feature more important in the matching process.
		</member>
	</members>
	<constants>
		<constant name="Raw" value="0" enum="NormalizationMode">
			No normalization is applied to the feature. The feature's output will be used as is.
		</constant>
		<constant name="Standard" value="1" enum="NormalizationMode">
			Uses standard normalization for the feature.
		</constant>
		<constant name="MinMax" value="2" enum="NormalizationMode">
			Uses min-max normalization for the feature.
		</constant>
