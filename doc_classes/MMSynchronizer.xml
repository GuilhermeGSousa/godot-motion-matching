	<brief_description>
		A class that synchronizes the a [MMCharacter] with its [Skeleton3D] node.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A [MMCharacter] always sets its [Skeleton3D] node to be a top level node, causing both to move independently. By default, the result of motion matching will bring the [Skeleton3D] to follow its [MMCharacter] through root motion.
		        While this can look acceptable in some cases, it is generally necessary to synchronize the [Skeleton3D] with its [MMCharacter]. The way this synchronization happens also depends on the use case of motion matching.
