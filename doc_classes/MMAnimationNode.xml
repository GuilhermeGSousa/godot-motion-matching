		<member name="blending_enabled" type="bool" setter="set_blending_enabled" getter="get_blending_enabled" default="true">
			Whether to enable blending between animations. If enabled, the node will blend between the selected animation and the previous animation based on the transition halflife.
		</member>
		<member name="library" type="StringName" setter="set_library" getter="get_library" default="&amp;&quot;&quot;">
			The [MMAnimationLibrary] to use for motion matching. This library contains the animations and their corresponding motion data.
		</member>
		<member name="query_frequency" type="float" setter="set_query_frequency" getter="get_query_frequency" default="2.0">
			The frequency at which the motion matching query is performed. A higher value means more frequent queries, which can lead to smoother transitions but may increase CPU usage.
		</member>
		<member name="transition_halflife" type="float" setter="set_transition_halflife" getter="get_transition_halflife" default="0.1">
			The halflife of the transition between animations. This value determines how quickly the node transitions between animations when a new animation is selected.
