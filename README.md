# Motion Matching for Godot 4.3

![](https://github.com/GuilhermeGSousa/godot-motion-matching/blob/master/motion_matching_demo.gif)

A motion matching implementation in Godot 4.3, implemented following [Dan Holden's article](https://www.theorangeduck.com/page/code-vs-data-driven-displacement).

:warning: **This repo is a work in progress!** :warning:

### Demo
The demo has now moved to a separate repository. You can find it [here!](https://github.com/GuilhermeGSousa/godot-motion-matching-demo).

### Wiki
[You can find this repo's wiki here!](https://github.com/GuilhermeGSousa/godot-motion-matching/wiki)

### Features
You'll find on this repo:
- A plugin that allow you to run motion matching queries on an animation dataset!
- A `CharacterBody3D` implementing a simple movement logic.
- Trajectory generation, including collisions and environmental checks.
- An editor to bake and visualize motion matching features.
- Blending nodes to qllow you to smoothly transition when switching animations.
